# Deaf-Blind-Communicator
## üéØ Aim
To **bridge the communication gap between blind and deaf/mute individuals** by enabling real-time, two-way interaction using **speech-to-text** and **text-to-speech** technologies.

## üí° Project Overview
This desktop-based Python application provides a GUI where:

- A **blind user** can speak ‚Üí their words are converted to text using speech recognition.
- A **deaf/mute user** can type ‚Üí their message is read aloud using a text-to-speech engine.
- A **webcam** detects a face before speech is recorded, ensuring speech input is intentional.
- A shared conversation box logs the entire communication, making it easy to follow.
